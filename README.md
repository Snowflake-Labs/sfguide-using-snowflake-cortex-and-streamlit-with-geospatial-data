# Using Snowflake Cortex and Streamlit with geospatial data

## Overview

In this guide, we will analyse and join location-based datasets together, visualise them and use Cortex to help save time presenting the information by returning descriptive narrative about restaurants and train stations that may be impacted by a large community event.  Cortex will also aid the writing of letters to Persons of Power, informing them of the disruption.  We will then simulate sample incidents that may take place all with the power of cortex - which will even include simulated social media activity.  By the end of the session, you will have an interactive Streamlit application - visualizing the events alongside the impacted restaurants and Train stations, along with a simulation of what may typically occur if they happen without re-risking measures taking place.
